This is a simple css and js that provoke that when you pass the mouse over a link an emergent window appear where it can be previewed the linked page.

This is basically a css effect but the content of the iframes are loaded via javascript in the moment you pass the mouse over links.

Also is added a decorative effect via css for the container of the iframe, that include a pair of images (in this case a pair of stones) in two of the corners.

An example can be seen here:
